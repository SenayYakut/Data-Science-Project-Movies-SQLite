# Data-Science-Project-Movies-SQLite

Write SQL queries to answer questions about a database of movies.

## Specifications
 
For each of the following problems, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query, though you may nest other queries inside of your query. You should not assume anything about the ids of any particular movies or people: your queries should be accurate even if the id of any particular movie or person were different. Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question: if the problem only asks you to output the names of movies, for example, then your query should not also output the each movie’s release year.

You’re welcome to check your queries’ results against IMDb itself, but realize that ratings on the website might differ from those in movies.db, as more votes might have been cast since we downloaded the data!
